# Minimalistic Football Worldcup Score Board

### Author: Kristoffer Schaaf

Developed as part of the Sportradar technical interview.

## Deps
- Java 21
- Maven
- Junit 6.0.3

### Comitting code
- Commit messages follow the 'conventional commit' principle for readability purposes
  (https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)

### Why no UI is implemented
This solution is intentionally implemented as a plain Java library without a user interface. 
The exercise explicitly asks for a **simple library** with an in-memory store and states that it is 
not looking for a REST API, web service or microservice. 
The requirements focus on core domain logic, test-driven development, clean code and SOLID principles.

### Requirements Engineering
To gain an initial idea of the system I created a small rudimentary component diagram.
This isn't final in any way. The final design of the system will be driven by the tests.
